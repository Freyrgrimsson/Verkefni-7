					<h4>Early life</h4>
					<p>Freddie Mercury was born with four extra incisors, in 1946 in a british territory that would soon become Tunisia, as Farrokh Bulsara. He went to british boarding schools from age 8, and formed a band when he was 12. After the boarding school, he moved back in with his parents at 17, and fled the Zanzibar revolution to middlesex in the UK in 1964. After studying music for a few years, he formed Queen with Roger Taylor and Brian May. </p>

				<h4>Music</h4>
				<p>Freddie had a remarkable vocal range, ususally sang in a different range than he spoke in, and was known for being able to switch between octaves and styles from line to line. Freddie wrote the majority of Queens greatest hits, and was known for incorporating a wide variety of genres into his songwriting, which was at times controversial, Bohemian Rhapsodo was for example, considered a fool's errand when he wrote it. Furthermore, his stage performances were known for being highly theatrical, and he incorporated the crowd more than most singers. </p>
